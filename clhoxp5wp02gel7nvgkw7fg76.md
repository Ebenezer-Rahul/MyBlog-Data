I’m Vangur Ebenezer Rahul Deepak, and I’m starting this journal to make myself a little accountable for how I use my time. I want to become a great developer and learn interesting things in the field of Computer Science. I also want to read and watch great stories. I want to enjoy my time. And I get a lot of joy from being able to solve something. writing what I think are good programs. And testing my abilities to understand something great and learn how things work.

I want to start my Journal this May and record and try to explain things/concepts I come across as I believe in

> “if you can’t explain simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”

As I think trying and making someone understand something, forces us to think why it(i.e something) makes sense. and you can’t fool yourself into believing that you understand something you don’t.

If it helps anybody, then I would be happy, even if not I think it would help me a lot.
